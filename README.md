Please check the official documentation at: [developers.augment.com](https://developers.augment.com/)

## Get started with Android

To get started with the Android Sample it is quite easy:

 - Open the `Android` directory with Android Studio
 - Edit the `com/augment/acmeshop/ACMEShop.java` file and add in your credentials
 - Build the App (on a real device) and you're ready to go!

## Get started with iOS

To get started with the iOS Sample it is quite easy:

 - Open `iOS/ACMEShop.xcworkspace` with Xcode
 - Edit the `ACMEShop.swift` file and add in your credentials
 - Build the App (on a real device) and you're ready to go!
 
Note: As you may see we use Cocoapods but we decided to include it in the repo so you don't have to worry about this.
If you want you can update it.
